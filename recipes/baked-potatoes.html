    <h3>Who doesn't love a good baked potato? There's something about a crispy skinned potato with a fluffy, pillowy interior that we just can't get enough of—it's one of our favorite ways to prepare the spud. What better way to amp up the standard steak house side? By stuffing them full of cheese, sour cream and bacon of course! Whether we're looking for a hearty side to our weeknight dinner, an impressive side dish for our holiday meal or simply an easy meal all on it's own, we turn to these cheesy loaded potatoes. </h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>4</b> large russet potatoes</li>
        <li><b>1/4</b> c. butter</li>
        <li><b>1/4</b> c. sour cream</li>
        <li><b>1/4</b> c. freshly chopped chives</li>
        <li><b>2</b> green onions, thinly sliced, white and green parts divided</li>
        <li><b>3/4</b> c. shredded Cheddar</li>
        <li><b>6</b> slices crispy bacon, crumbled</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. Prick potatoes all over with a fork or sharp knife and wrap tightly in foil. Bake until soft, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Unwrap potatoes and cut lengthwise slits in the top of each. Carefully scoop out flesh from center of each potato into a medium bowl, then add butter, sour cream, chives, green onion whites, half the cheddar, and half the bacon. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spoon filling back into each potato, mounding it on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and return to oven until melted, about 5 minutes. Top with scallion greens and remaining bacon.</li>
    </ol>
