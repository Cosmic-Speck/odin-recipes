    <h3>Who doesn't love a good baked potato? There's something about a crispy skinned potato with a fluffy, pillowy interior that we just can't get enough ofâ€”it's one of our favorite ways to prepare the spud. What better way to amp up the standard steak house side? By stuffing them full of cheese, sour cream and bacon of course! Whether we're looking for a hearty side to our weeknight dinner, an impressive side dish for our holiday meal or simply an easy meal all on it's own, we turn to these cheesy loaded potatoes. </h3>
